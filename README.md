# Easy
*Easy* is a 2D Game Engine written in C++ on top of OpenGL.
Its aim is to provide an easy to use framework for game developers,
who don't to give a damn about platform specific implementations.

As an user of the engine, you'll be just exposed to an game editor 
and the Lua scripting API.

## Contribution
The project as it is, is in very early development. Therefore you,
presumably a developer (if not, why are you on GitHub?), you're 
asked to contribute and be part of the team.

If you want to be part of the Team, just contact me per Email
